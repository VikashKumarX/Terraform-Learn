# Terraform-Learn

# Infrastructure as Code Tool Means
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is an approach to managing data center server, storage, and networking infrastructure. IaC is meant to significantly simplify large-scale configuration and management. With traditional data center infrastructure management, every configuration change required manual action by operators and system administrators. With IaC, infrastructure configuration information is housed in standardized files, which can be read by software that maintains the state of the infrastructure. IaC can improve productivity and reliability because it eliminates manual configuration steps.
Infrastructure as code benefits:-
1)Improved productivity. Administrators and operators no longer must perform manual configuration steps for data center infrastructure changes. 2)Improved reliability. The configuration of the infrastructure is contained in electronic files, and software is responsible for initiating infrastructure changes, so there is less chance of human error.
